# Advent of Code 2023
Welcome to advent of code 2023! 

## Language
Although having done some projects before in C, 
there are definitely concepts I have not used before in general or within C, 
such as pointers, memory allocation, and 2D arrays. One of my goals this year is to get more familiar with C. <br>
On day 7 I got fed up with things not working as I expect, and decided to switch to Python3 to have more fun. Python should be version 3.10 or higher.

## Input files
Put you inputs into src/inputs as a .txt file. The naming structure this year is a follows: "inputXX.txt" 
where XX is the number of the days, including leading zero's.

## Libraries (Python)
Any library used but not in this list is assumed to be a standard library

- numpy
- networkx

## Interesting Puzzles
day09: Interesting to learn an algorithm to find the previous or next number in a sequence <br>
day12: Reminded me of a [nonogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram), but in one dimension.
Algorithm implemented resembles the way I would solve a nonogram. <br>
day18: Learned about [pick's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick%27s_theorem) and [shoelace theory](https://www.geodose.com/2021/09/how-calculate-polygon-area-unordered-coordinates-points-python.html) today <br>
day19: Enjoyed this puzzle where I had to check an input against a given set of rules (which were part of the puzzle input)
