## General
Day0 is a template. <br>
In every folder/package add a file called "input.txt" with your input, unless stated otherwise. <Br>
Day17 and Day21 do not need an input.txt or there is a specific field where the input should go. Because I write this more than a year after writing the code, you should figure out what the input fields are if you want to use the code.


## Day22
Day 22 was a long-lasting puzzle that was open. In my final solution, I tried to write tests before I implemented the code, where all methods should return something.
