# Advent of Code 2023
Welcome to advent of code 2023! Although having done some projects before in C, 
there are definitely concepts I have not used before in general or within C, 
such as pointers, memory allocation, and 2D arrays. One of my goals this year is to get more familiar with C.

## Input files
Put you inputs into src/inputs as a .txt file. The naming structure this year is a follows: "inputXX.txt" 
where XX is the number of the days, including leading zero's.

## Libraries
I make use of the [libeom library](https://github.com/ericomeehan/libeom). Necessary files are already included.
