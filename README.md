# AdventOfCode

All my [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions in one repository. <br>
Remember, not all code is optimized nor the smartest implementation. The code is written to get me to the answer, 
and not to be optimized for production. It also can contain hard-coded variables, when allowed by the puzzle. 
Personal inputs are not provided, each year folder has a README with instructions on how to add you own input.<br>
2021 is the first year I tried AoC during december.
