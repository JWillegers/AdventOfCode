# AdventOfCode

All my [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions in one repository. <br>
Remember, not all code is optimized nor the smartest implementation. The code is written to get me to the answer, 
and not to be optimized for production. It also can contain hard-coded variables, when allowed by the puzzle. 
Personal inputs are not provided, each year folder has a README with instructions on how to add you own input.<br>
y2021 is the first year I tried AoC during december. 

Table of the year and the language I used for that said year.

| Year | Language    |
|------|-------------|
| 2020 | Java        |
| 2021 | Java        |
| 2022 | Python3     |
| 2023 | C & Python3 | 

## Setup

### Java (Intellij)
Right click on pom.xml and click on "Add as maven project". 
In file->Project Structure add the root folder of this project as Sources

### Python
Depending on the year, go to that years README.md and find which packages need to be installed

## Interesting puzzles
All years (excl. 2020 & 2021) have a README.md which contains a section called 'Interesting puzzles'.
In these sections I indicate which puzzles I found interesting to make at the time, possibly with reasons why.
